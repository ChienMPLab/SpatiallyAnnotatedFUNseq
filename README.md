# SpatiallyAnnotatedFUNseq
We previously described spatially annotated single-cell sequencing, a method to spatially profile intratumor heterogeneity with deep scRNA-seq and single-cell resolution. Here, we have deposited all scripts required for analyzing the scRNA-seq data obtained using spatially annotated single-cell sequencing. 

More detailed information about the execution of the protocol and analysis of the results can be found in:
Smit, M.M. & Chien, M.-P. (2023). Protocol for profiling intratumor heterogeneity using spatially annotated single  cell sequencing. STAR Protocols (under review)
